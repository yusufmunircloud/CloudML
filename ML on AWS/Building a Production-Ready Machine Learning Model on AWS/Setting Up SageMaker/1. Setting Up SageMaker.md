# Setting Up Amazon SageMaker Notebook Instances 🖥️
## Introduction
In this section, we'll walk through the process of setting up Amazon SageMaker notebook instances, which are powerful one-click Jupyter notebooks provided by AWS. These instances offer flexibility in terms of memory, GPU, and CPU configurations, making them versatile for various machine learning tasks.

## Overview
Amazon SageMaker notebooks allow users to specify the type of memory, GPU, and CPU they want to use, providing a wide range of configurations. The pricing model involves paying per hour for these instances, with costs varying based on the instance's specifications, such as memory, CPUs, and GPUs.

## Steps to Set Up SageMaker Notebook Instances 📝
### 1. Accessing SageMaker
→ Open the AWS console and navigate to SageMaker.

→ Click on "Studio" to access the SageMaker Studio environment and click `Add User Profile`.

### 2. Creating a New User Role 🛠️ 
→ If it's your first time, you'll need to select `create a new role` from the execution role dropdown.

→ Specify S3 access requirements, which is crucial for storing training data, trained models, and other resources.

→ If you haven't created any S3 buckets yet, choose "Any S3 bucket" for now. 📂

### 3. Configuring the Role 🛠️
→ Click on "Create Role" to generate the necessary role with the specified S3 access.

→ Keep clicking `Next` and on the final step scroll down and click `Submit`.

### 5. Checking Pricing and Free Tier 🆓
→ While waiting for the instance to be created, explore AWS SageMaker pricing here.

→ Review the free tier offerings if you've started your Amazon account within a year.

→ Take note of the on-demand pricing for different instance types.

### 6. Exploring Instance Types 📊
→ Investigate different instance types available for SageMaker notebooks, considering memory, virtual CPUs, and GPUs.

→ For training, focus on instances with GPUs for accelerated computing.

### 7. SageMaker Domain 🧠
→ When you created the user profile, there should of been a Sagemaker domain being created, observe it and wait for it to be `InService`. Then we can move on to the next section!
