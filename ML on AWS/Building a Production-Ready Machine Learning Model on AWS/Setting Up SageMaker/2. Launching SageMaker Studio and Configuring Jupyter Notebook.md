# Introduction
In this section, we will continue with the setup of the SageMaker environment, specifically focusing on launching SageMaker Studio and configuring a Jupyter Notebook for machine learning tasks. SageMaker Studio provides an online programming environment that facilitates the management of Jupyter Notebooks with customizable configurations, including memory size, CPU, and GPU specifications.

## Steps to Launch SageMaker Studio and Configure Jupyter Notebook
### 1. Accessing SageMaker Studio
• Confirm that your SageMaker domain is ready and up and running.

• Navigate to SageMaker and check the status; it should be marked as "InService" with the default user.

• Navigate and click on your Domain then to the right of User Profiles click `Launch` and from the dropdown select `Studio`

### 2. Understanding SageMaker Studio
Note that SageMaker Studio is not the Jupyter Notebook itself; it is a complete online programming environment.

SageMaker Studio allows you to configure Jupyter Notebooks with specific memory, CPU, and GPU settings.

### 3. Creating a New Jupyter Notebook
• Click on "File," then go to "New" and select "Notebook."

• Choose a Docker image; for this demonstration, the default data science Docker image with Anaconda is used.

• Specify the kernel, selecting Python 3.

### 4. Handling Kernel Issues
• If the kernel fails to start, go to the "Kernel" menu, select "Restart Kernel," and then try specifying the image again.

• This situation is rare but can be resolved by restarting the kernel.

### 5. Specifying Instance Type
• In the "Instance Type" section, choose the type of instance you want to use.

• The instances displayed are limited because "Fast Launch" is enabled; it shows instances that launch quickly.

• Specify the instance type based on your needs; for this demonstration, the Ml t3 medium instance is used, which is cost-effective for exploratory tasks.

• Save the configuration by clicking "Save and Continue."

### 6. Exploring Instance Types and Costs
• Understand the different instance types available for SageMaker Studio, considering memory, CPU, and GPU configurations.

• Note the associated costs; in this example, the Ml t3 medium instance costs $0.05 per hour.

• For training, instances with GPUs (accelerated compute) are recommended, but they come at a higher cost.

### 7. Confirming Configuration
• Review the selected instance type and its associated cost.

• Confirm that the configuration aligns with your requirements.

### 8. Launching SageMaker Studio
• Click "Save and Continue" to proceed with launching SageMaker Studio.

• Wait for the Studio environment to load; this may take some time, especially if it's your first time accessing it.

### 9. Verifying the Jupyter Notebook Configuration
• Once the Studio is loaded, confirm that the Jupyter Notebook environment is ready.

• Verify that the correct Python kernel and instance type are set up.
