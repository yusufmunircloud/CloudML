# Predicting Stock Prices with Amazon Sagemaker - Getting Started

Welcome to the Stock Price Predictor project! 🚀 In this project, we'll explore the exciting realm of artificial intelligence and machine learning, and the best part? You won't have to write a single line of code! 🤯 If you've been eager to dive into AI and ML but didn't know where to start, you're in the right place.

## Project Overview 📊
We'll be delving into a stock price prediction project using core AWS services. Our journey includes leveraging Amazon S3 for data storage, utilizing a publicly accessible dataset from NASDAQ, employing Amazon SageMaker Canvas for machine learning predictions, and finally, creating a visually appealing dashboard with Amazon QuickSight.

### Project Steps:
1. **Configuring Prerequisites**: Setting up the necessary configurations and prerequisites to utilize our dataset in AWS.
2. **Building Predictions with SageMaker Canvas**: Using a low-code approach to build machine learning models with SageMaker Canvas.
3. **Generating Predictions**: Utilizing a specific model to generate predictions based on the data we've gathered.
4. **Creating a Visualization Dashboard**: Using QuickSight to visualize and understand the predictions.

## Architecture Overview 🏗️
1. **Historical Data Collection**: Gathering historical data from NASDAQ, a central hub for financial investments.
2. **Data Modification and Storage**: Modifying the dataset and uploading it to an S3 bucket in AWS.
3. **Machine Learning Model Building**: Using SageMaker Canvas for a low-code implementation of AI to build a predictive model.
4. **Data Visualization with QuickSight**: Visualizing forecasted datasets with Amazon QuickSight.

## What to Expect 🚧
Over the next series of steps, I will guide you through each step, helping you set up your SageMaker domain, work with Canvas, and handle your dataset efficiently. Please note, this project is not meant for investment purposes or financial advice; it's an exploration of how data can be used to predict future trends.

## Closing Thoughts 🎉
Excited to embark on this AI and ML journey with you! Stay tuned for the upcoming steps where I'll guide you through setting up and building your own Stock Price Predictor. Looking forward to building alongside you! 👋
